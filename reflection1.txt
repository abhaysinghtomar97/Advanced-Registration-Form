Approach:

The form is structured using  for grouping related fields,  for titles, and ARIA attributes for accessibility.
 Each section logically organizes user input types. The design focuses on usability and clarity.


Challenges included ensuring proper validation, maintaining a responsive layout, and learning to 
use ARIA attributes effectively to improve accessibility for users with assistive technologies.


Learning:

I learned the importance of field, titles, and ARIA attributes in enhancing accessibility and usability. 
Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of structuring forms semantically, 
ensuring proper validation techniques, and creating user-friendly forms that adhere to best practices for web development.
Loved this exercise......
